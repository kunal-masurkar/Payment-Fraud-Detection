# Payment-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a logistic regression model to detect fraudulent online payment transactions. Using a dataset of credit card transactions (credit_data.csv), the notebook preprocesses the data by separating features from the target variable (Class), which indicates fraud or non-fraud.
